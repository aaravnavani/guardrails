# Capture Metrics for your Guards

This package is instrumented using the OpenTelemetry Python SDK. By viewing the captured traces and derived metrics, we're able to get useful insights into how our Guards, and our LLM apps in general perform. Among other things, we're able to find:

1. Latency of Guards
2. Latency of LLMs
3. Success rates of Guards
4. The rate at which validators Pass and Fail, within a Guard and across Guards
5. Deep dives into singular guard and validator calls

Since we are using OpenTelemetry, traces and metrics can be written to any OpenTelemetry enabled service or OTLP endpoint. This includes all major metrics providers like Grafana, New Relic, Prometheus, and Splunk.

This guide will show how to set up your python project to log traces to Grafana and an OTEL collector.


## Setup with Grafana

Grafana Cloud is a free offering by Grafana that's easy to setup and is our preferred location for storing metrics.

### Get environment variables from Grafana

<video autoPlay={true} style={{width: "100%"}} loop={true} controls={true}>
 <source src={GrafanaOtelConfig} type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

1. Sign up with the Grafana cloud (it's free!) https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user. 
2. Once your account is up, create a stack.
3. Navigate away to https://grafana.com/ and click the "My Account" button on the top right of the screen
4. Scroll down and click on the "Configure" button in the "Open Telemetry" section of the page
5. Click "generate token"
6. Compile the instance ID, token, and environment variables 
GRAFANA_INSTANCE_ID
TOKEN
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS

### Setup a Guard with Telemetry

We first have to install the ```ValidLength``` guardrail from Guardrails Hub.

```guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/valid_length```

Then, set up your Guard the default tracer provided in the guardrails library. You can still use your desired validators

<h5 a><strong><code>main.py</code></strong></h5>
```python
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.utils.telemetry_utils import default_otlp_tracer
from guardrails.hub import ValidLength
import openai

guard = Guard.from_string(
  validators=[ValidLength(min=1, max=10, on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION)],
  # use a descriptive name that will differentiate where your metrics are stored
  tracer=default_otlp_tracer("petname_guard")
)

guard(
  llm_api=openai.chat.completions.create,
  prompt="Suggest a name for my cat.",
  model="gpt-4",
  max_tokens=1024,
  temperature=0.5,
)
```

Before running the file, make sure to set the environment variables you got from Grafana

```bash
export GRAFANA_INSTANCE_ID=
export TOKEN=

# these come from the 'copy environment variables' button
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=
# IMPORTANT: Make sure to replace the space after "Basic" with "%20".
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=
```

Finally, run the python script

```bash

python main.py

```

### Viewing traces

The simplest way to do this is to go to your grafana stack and click on the "Explore" tab. You should see a list of traces that you can filter by service name, operation name, and more.

<video autoPlay={true} style={{width: "100%"}} loop={true} controls={true}>
 <source src={ViewTraces} type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

While this is easy to do, it's not the best way to get a big-picture view of how your guards are doing. For that, we should use the Guardrails Grafana dashboard template.

The template can be found here https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20600-standard-guardrails-dash/
and instructions to use the template are found here https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/import-dashboards/

## OTEL Collector

For advanced use cases (like if you have a metrics provider in a VPC), you can use a self-hosted OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces and metrics from your Guard.
Standard [open telemetry environment variables](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html#configure-the-exporter) are used to configure the collector. Use the default_otel_collector_tracer when configuring your guard.

```python
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.utils.telemetry_utils import default_otel_collector_tracer
from guardrails.hub import ValidLength
import openai

guard = Guard.from_string(
  validators=[ValidLength(min=1, max=10, on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION)],
  # use a descriptive name that will differentiate where your metrics are stored
  tracer=default_otel_collector_tracer("petname_guard")
)

guard(
  llm_api=openai.chat.completions.create,
  prompt="Suggest a name for my cat.",
  model="gpt-4",
  max_tokens=1024,
  temperature=0.5,
)
```
